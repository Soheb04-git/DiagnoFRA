## 🚀 Why DiagnoFRA?  

Power transformers are the backbone of electrical grids.  
Yet, failures are often **unpredictable, costly, and catastrophic**.  

⚠️ **Problems with existing methods:**  
- ❌ Traditional FRA is hard to interpret manually  
- ❌ No real-time anomaly detection  
- ❌ Lack of explainable diagnostics for engineers  

✨ **DiagnoFRA solves this.**  
- ✅ Combines **Frequency Response Analysis (FRA)** with **AI/ML**  
- ✅ Offers **real-time monitoring** of magnitude & phase response  
- ✅ Provides **explainable diagnostics** with confidence scores  
- ✅ Enables **baseline vs. measured comparisons**

## ✨ Features  

- 📊 **Real-time Health Monitoring** → Track FRA curves in magnitude and phase  
- 🔎 **Root-cause Diagnostics** → Pinpoint axial/radial deformations, insulation issues, core grounding faults  
- ⚠️ **Anomaly Detection** → Detect drifts & failures before they escalate  
- 🖥️ **Interactive Dashboards** → Zoomable FRA plots with AI overlays  
- 📑 **Explainable Reports** → Fault localization, recommendations, and confidence levels  
- 🔄 **Baseline Comparisons** → Overlay reference vs. measured responses
